# FormHack

FormHack is a hackable [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com)-based css form reset. Although there are standard css resets for forms out there, I wanted to created one that I could easily customize for any site, without having to worry about cross-browser compatibility and differences. 

FormHack works by providing a few variables that allow you to change some common attributes such as border-radius, input height/width, and colours. By changing these attributes, you will get a beautiful form that is consistent across all major browsers. I have also organised the code in a way that is (hopefully) easy for you to edit if you want to alter more than the given settings.

If you have any questions or suggestions for how I can make this better, tweet me at [@ireaderinokun](https://twitter.com/ireaderinokun).
